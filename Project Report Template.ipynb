    "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal imbalance in women that can cause infertility. It is one of the most common endocrine and metabolic disorders in women of reproductive age.

An opportunity exists for preventive therapy, which could improve the reproductive, metabolic, and cardiovascular risks.\n",

According to the National Institute of Health [1], the reason for the higher rates of PCOS in India is due to loose guidelines for management and awareness of the syndrome. Due to this issue, our goal is to shed light on the important factors, qualities, and circumstances that may be related to an increase in PCOS for women all across the world."
